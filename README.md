# DropTracker

Shares your drops with the [DropTracker](https://www.droptracker.io/) database.

Any player using our plugin is automatically tracked, with every drop they receive stored in a database.
"Loot Leaderboards" are generated to display, in a "bank window" format, the top 12 players per server and globally (all players who downloaded the plugin).
