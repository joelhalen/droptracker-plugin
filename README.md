## **Getting Started**:
### Players
Players can track their drops and achievements instantly by simply installing our plugin. No further configuration is needed.
- You can, optionally, enable **Use API Connections** in the plugin configuration to allow looking up other players inside the DropTracker side panel.

    If you are part of a group, you can optionally **claim your accounts** within your group's Discord server, using the `/claim-rsn` command.

### Groups
For groups, to begin tracking you'll first need to join our [support discord server](https://www.droptracker.io/discord) and invite the **DropTracker.io Discord Bot** to your server.

    Creating a group has a pre-requisite of obtaining your group's WiseOldMan ID. This is a 3-6 digit code, with no special characters. Please DO NOT share your group's verification code with us!

- Once you've invited the bot to your server, please [click here to read more](https://www.droptracker.io/wiki/create-group) about creating and configuring your group.
