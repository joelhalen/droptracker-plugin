The DropTracker RuneLite plugin is intended to be used as an automated method of submitting your drops to the Loot Leaderboard.

Loot Leaderboards exist in servers that have contacted me and asked to be included in the tracker system I've created.

If you're interested in learning more about this project, feel free to contact me on Discord: Joel Halen#0650

Once you have installed the plugin, you must enter a valid Server ID for a clan that has registered in the database. If you would like to join the tracking system, feel free to contact me and we'll get you started!

Please make sure you check your discord message requests if you see a chat message letting you know that there has been an authentication token DMed to you, but you don't see it. It's likely that your privacy settings are the cause.
