# DropTracker

There are two ways to use the DropTracker:
**Using the API**
1. Sign up for the DropTracker via Discord, inside of a clan using the lootboard system!
2. Enter your authentication key and server ID into the plugin config
3. Start tracking drops!
**Using Google Sheets**
1. Visit https://www.droptracker.io/sheets/
2. Find an available sheet template
3. Copy the 'ID' field and place it in the plugin config
4. Your drops are tracked!

**Features (with api toggled on)**:
1. Real-time monthly loot tallies for players and for your clan:

2. Loot Leaderboards inside of your Discord server to show the "top looters":

3. A website with global metrics and per-player stats, etc (with loads of expansion coming...)


Authentication keys that are unique to each player, to prevent users from submitting bogus drops for your events/leaderboard:

All drops received using the plugin are automatically uploaded to the database if the user has a valid authentication token entered.

Automatic calculation of drop values based on split sizes (configurable). Players can submit drops with other clan members receiving the split as credit towards their total loot that month.

And much more coming soon! Stay tuned! :)
