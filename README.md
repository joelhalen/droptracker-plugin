The DropTracker RuneLite plugin is intended to be used in sync with the Discord bot, and by players in servers who have a loot leaderboard set up.

**Features**:
Automatic generation of verification keys for each user if they exist in your server:

_This means that drops with an non-matching verification key, or from a user not registered, will be **completely ignored** by the clan's Loot Leaderboard!_

Automated tracking of all drops received:
