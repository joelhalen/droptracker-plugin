# DropTracker

This plugin is intended to be used in tandem with the DropTracker discord bot to maintain loot leaderboards and drop metrics for members of your clan.
There is also planned functionality for fully-automated events based off of the Discord bot/RuneLite plugin.

**Features**:
> Real-time monthly loot tallies for players and for your clan:

> Loot Leaderboards inside of your Discord server to show the "top looters":

> A website with an Administration Panel for clan owners to modify their servers, enable events, view drop metrics, etc.

Authentication keys that are unique to each player, to prevent users from submitting bogus drops for your events/leaderboard:

Automatic calculation of drop values based on split sizes (configurable). Players can submit drops with other clan members receiving the split as credit towards their total loot that month.

And much more coming soon! Stay tuned! :)
